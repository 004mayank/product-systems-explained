# How Tech Systems Work

Modern software systems are complex.
Clear explanations of how they actually work are rare.

This repository breaks down real-world tech systems and architectures —
from first principles to real-world usage.

## What this repo focuses on
- System architectures and components
- How data flows through systems
- Trade-offs behind design decisions
- How modern systems scale, fail, and recover

## What this repo does NOT cover
- Programming tutorials or language syntax
- Career advice or interview prep
- High-level buzzwords without depth

## What you’ll find here
- How APIs and backend systems work
- How databases and storage systems behave
- How event-driven systems function
- How search, recommendation, and AI systems are built
- How distributed systems handle scale and failure

## How to read this repo
Each document answers one question:
> **How does this system actually work end to end?**

Concepts build on each other.
You can start anywhere.

## Who this is for
- Engineers who want system-level clarity
- Product Managers working on technical products
- Architects and builders who want clean mental models
